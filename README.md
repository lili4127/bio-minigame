# Bio Minigame
My program will be an interactive mobile game where students can learn biology concepts.

## Description of project goal:
My program will consist of identification minigames (i.e. identifying the parts of a cell, an interactive timed cell cycle game). The goal of this game is to teach biology concepts in an engaging manner. This is useful to students that may be trying to find the motivation to learn biology.
