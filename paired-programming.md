### Goal of the project:
The goal for this project is to create a identification bio-mini game. And It is clear to me the goal can be accomplished by using python, `kivy`, `numpy`, `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.
### The data 
It is clear to me the data for this project is image that stored in a json format.
And the data for leaderboard will be stored in the csv format and will be hosted online. 
### The code 
* The current code include a proper skeleton for starting this project. 
* This code so far have data and can identify users' input as correct/incorrect. Also, the code also can update leaderboard and get leaderboard info. 
#### The possible contribution 
I can help creating REST api for the leaderboard. To do so, I created the `app.py` under `/minigame` file. Inside the `app.py`, I wrote the **request** body. So the data can be send to the API from the users.
